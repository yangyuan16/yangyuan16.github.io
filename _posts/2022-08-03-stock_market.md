### government
>Therefore, we examine whether return predictability and portfolio performance are compromised for SOEs 
>where government signaling plays such a prominent role.

### Machine Learning
> As out-of-sample R^2 has some limitations for model selection, 
> we analyze the models' <font color=red>conditional predictive ability</font> using a 
> statistical test recently developed in <font color=red>Li, Liao and Quaedvlieg (2020)</font>,
> which allows us to compare the performance of machine learning methods 
> in different macroeconomic environments. 
>(R^2 并不能作为衡量所有机器学习模型的一个普适的指标。Li, Liao, Quaedvlieg 发展出的
>方法能够评价机器学习在宏观经济环境中的表现！！！)

>### Predictors Classification
> (1) related to market liquidity
>
> (2) related to fundamental factors like valuation ratios (pe, eps, ep, roe)
