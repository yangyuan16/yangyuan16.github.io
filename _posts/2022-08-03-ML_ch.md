> Notes for reading paper [Machine Learning in Chinese Stock Market](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.08.017)

>out-of-sample R^2
>
> (2) The out-of-sample R^2 are particularly large for the subsamples 
>of <font color=red>small firms</font> and non-state-owned firms. Hence,
>predictability is more significant for those subsamples of stocks in which <font color=red>retail traders</font> plays a much bigger role.
>
>(3) Comparing the out-of-sample R^2 with studies in the U.S. market, 
>the Chinese market reveals substantially more predictability. 

### Methods
> (1) observe the market liquidity
