### Abstract
> Notes for reading paper [Machine Learning in Chinese Stock Market](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.08.017)

### Main results
> (1) Neutral networks robustly outperform other methods in terms of 
>out-of-sample R^2
>
> (2) The out-of-sample R^2 are particularly large for the subsamples 
>of <font color=red>small firms</font> and non-state-owned firms. Hence,
>predictability is more significant for those subsamples of stocks in which <font color=red>retail traders</font> plays a much bigger role.
>
>(3) Comparing the out-of-sample R^2 with studies in the U.S. market, 
>the Chinese market reveals substantially more predictability. 

### other results
> We also find that predictability of SOEs (国有企业) in terms of out-of-sample predictive R^2 
> is <font color=red>weaker</font> than for <font color=red>non-SOEs</font> at 
>a <font color=red>monthly prediction horizon</font>, which confirms the SOE's reputation of 
>being <font color=red>non-transparent</font> (国企的声誉并不透明). 



### Methods
> (1) observe the market liquidity
