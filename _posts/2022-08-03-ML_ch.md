### Abstract
> Notes for reading paper [Machine Learning in Chinese Stock Market](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.08.017)

### Main results
> (1) Neutral networks robustly outperform other methods in terms of 
>out-of-sample R^2
>
> (2) The out-of-sample R^2 are particularly large for the subsamples 
>of <font color=red>small firms</font> and non-state-owned firms. Hence,
>predictability is more significant for those subsamples of stocks in which <font color=red>retail traders</font> plays a much bigger role.
>
>(3) Comparing the out-of-sample R^2 with studies in the U.S. market, 
>the Chinese market reveals substantially more predictability. 
>
>(4) out-of-sample predictability.
>
>(5) unconditional and conditional predictive ability test.
>
>(6) explores whether predictability translates into portfolio gains.
>

### other results
> We also find that predictability of SOEs (国有企业) in terms of out-of-sample predictive R^2 
> is <font color=red>weaker</font> than for <font color=red>non-SOEs</font> at 
>a <font color=red>monthly prediction horizon</font>, which confirms the SOE's reputation of 
>being <font color=red>non-transparent</font> (国企的声誉并不透明). 
>
>Our results indicate that also that a long-only portfolio can provide substantial and, 
>even after including transaction costs, economically signicant performance
> (我们的结果还表明，一个只做多的投资组合可以提供实质性的、甚至包括交易成本在内的经济显著的业绩 )



### Methods and Data
#### Methods
* (1) Apply the empirical design of Gu et al. (2020b) to the Chinese market.

#### Data
* (1) WIND

* (2) CSMAR

* (3) Predictors: [Green et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhx019).
The characteristic that provide independent information about average US monthly stock return.
A large collection of stock-level predictive characteristic based on the variable definitions in
the original literature listed in [Green et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhx019), 
and the literature on China-specific factors. 

#### Data process
* (1) classify predictors
> 90 * 1 vector of stock-level characteristics, 11 * 1 vector of macroeconomic predictors,
> 80 * 1 vector of dummy variables


* (2) interaction term between two groups of predictors
> Using <font color=red>Kronecker product</font> (直乘) to represent the interaction terms 
> between stock-level characteristics and the eleven macroeconomic predictors:
