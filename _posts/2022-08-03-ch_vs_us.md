> ===========================
>
> Chinese stock market is dominated by retail investors. The <font color=red>speculative</font> 
> and short-term trading motives of many retail investors may lead to 
>increased <font color=red>turnover</font>. 
> * According to the 2019 yearbook of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, there are 214.5 million
    investors in china, 213.8 million are <font color=red>individual investors</font>, and 0.7 million are 
    <font color=red>institutional investors</font> 
> * the value of shares traded stood at 224% of <font color=red>market capitalization</font>
  in 2019, compared to 108% for the U.S. market.

### large stocks and state-owned enterprises
>Another feature that distinguishes the Chinese from the U.S. market is the high 
>predictability of large stocks and state-owned enterprises over longer horizons.

### market size
>As of October 2020, the total value of China's stock market has climbed to 
>a record high of more than $10 trillion, as the country's accelerating economic 
>recovery from the pandemic has surpassed the previous high reached during an 
>equity bubble five years ago, making it the second-largest in the 
>world, after the U.S. at nearly $39 trillion.

### politic 
>(1)For example, the process of IPOs and seasonal stock offerings is highly political, 
>and companies cannot predict when the market value will be high.
>
>(2)On the other hand, <font color=red>listed companies</font>, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 
>are prevented from shares buy-back when share prices fall below fundamental values.
These automatic market correction mechanisms are therefore affected by government-oriented restrictions

### long-short strategies
> While most of the literature on <font color=red>factor investing</font> in
> U.S. and European markets rely on long-short strategies, such a strategy is 
> less realistic for Chinese market. Hence, we also analyze <font color=red> long-only portfolios</font>
> which are more relevant from a practitioner's viewpoint.
