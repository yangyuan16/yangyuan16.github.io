<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Most anomalies fail to hold up to currently acceptable standards for 
empirical finance.With microcaps mitigated via NYSE breakpoints and 
value-weighted returns, 65% of the 452 anomalies in our extensive data library, 
including 96% of the trading frictions category, cannot clear the single test 
hurdle of the absolute t-value of 1.96. Imposing the higher multiple test hurdle of 
2.78 at the 5% significance level raises the failure rate to 82%.
Even for replicated anomalies, their economic magnitudes are 
much smaller than originally reported. 
In all, capital markets are more efficient than previously recognized.
