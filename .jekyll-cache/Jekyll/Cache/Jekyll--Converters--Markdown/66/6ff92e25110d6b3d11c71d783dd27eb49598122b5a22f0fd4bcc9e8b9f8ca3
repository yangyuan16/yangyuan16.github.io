(We attribute the short-term predictability, particularly for small stocks, to retail investorsâ€™ prominent role in the Chinese stock market. As we will see later, at shorter horizons, neural nets put more weight on volatility and momentum-related variables for small stocks, which may reflect the short-term speculative behavior of retail investors, together with their well-known
preference for trading small stocks)</p>

  <p>Another feature that distinguishes the Chinese from the U.S. market is the high 
predictability of large stocks and state-owned enterprises over longer horizons. 
The out-of-sample performance remains economically significant 
after <font color="red"> transaction costs</font>.</p>

  <p>It seems that predicting SOEsâ€™ returns requires a highly flexible method that can
account for nonlinear effect. This additional complexity may be required since
SOEs are controlled by the state, having two primary objectives:
to generate profit and to carry out state policies.

<h3 id="transaction-costs">Transaction costs:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>For the Chinese market, the cost of A-share transaction mainly consists of 
three components:</p>

  <p>(1) commission ä½£é‡‘: In the Chinese stock market, commission fee for institutional investors
was around 5 bps in 2012 but decreased quickly after then. In recent years, commission fee is
usually 2-3 bps for retail investors and even lower for institutional investors.</p>

  <p>(2) stamp tax å°èŠ±ç¨: The stamp tax is set to 10 bps since 2008 and is collected unilaterally for
sellers.</p>

  <p>(3) slippage æ»‘ç‚¹</p>

  <p>In some rare cases, such as 2015 Chinese stock market turbulence, the scale of slippage can 
be quite large as the stock market goes up or down flercely right after stock market opening.
However, in such cases, the signs of buying and selling slippage are likely the same,
which could partly reduce the actual slippage that investors face

thus are less affected by the daily price limits of 10% in China. (å¤§å‹è‚¡ç¥¨çš„æµåŠ¨æ€§æ°´å¹³ä¸€èˆ¬æ›´é«˜ï¼Œ

<h3 id="politic">politic</h3>

  <p>(1)For example, the process of IPOs and seasonal stock offerings is highly political, 
and companies cannot predict when the market value will be high.</p>

  <p>(2)On the other hand, <font color="red">listed companies</font>, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 
are prevented from shares buy-back when share prices fall below fundamental values.
These automatic market correction mechanisms are therefore affected by government-oriented restrictions</p>

  <p>(3)Given that China has been experiencing a highly dynamic development through a series of structural breaks, implementing various 
financial reforms, and expanding its capital marketsâ€™ openness, we conjecture that highly 
fiexible methods are required to account for the Chinese marketâ€™s specificity.</p>

  <p>China has been adopting an approval-based IPO system ever since its stock market opened,

role in predicting monthly returns.

Many of the previous literature results relate to the performance

  <p>Their results suggest that machine learning improves the description of expected return and, 
when applied to portfolio construction, performance improvements arise most prominently among 
the more sophisticated models and are due in large part to the allowance of non-linear predictor 
interactions that are missed by simpler methods</p>

  <p>Although machine learning may substantially improve the pricing of assets, Arnott et al. (2019),

  <p>Comparing the out-of-sample R^2 with studies in the U.S. market, the Chinese

  <p>It is noteworthy that the OLS model performs much better in Chinaâ€™s stock market than

in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhaa009">Gu et al. (2020b)</a>.</p>

  <p>Such significant gaps in R^2 further motivates us to consider the fundamental difference
between these two markets, which we conjecture, can be attributed to two critical aspects.
First, the Chinese stock market is characterized by a large fraction of retail investors
and their preference for small-cap stocks. Second, the Chinese stock market is influenced 
by the prevalence of state-owned enterprises, which are less transparent than private firms.</p>
