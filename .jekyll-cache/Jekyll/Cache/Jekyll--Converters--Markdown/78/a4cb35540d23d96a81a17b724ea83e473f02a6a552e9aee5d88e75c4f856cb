    <li>Quantum computers can solve specific problems that are not 
feasible on “classical” hardware. Harvesting the speed-up provided 
by quantum computers therefore has the potential to change any 
industry which uses computation, including finance. 
First quantum applications for the financial industry involving optimization, 
simulation, and machine learning problems have already been proposed and 
applied to use cases such as portfolio management, risk management, 
and pricing derivatives. This survey reviews platforms, algorithms, 
methodologies, and use cases of quantum computing for various applications 
in finance in a structured way. It is aimed at people working in the financial 
industry and serves to gain an overview of the current development and 
capabilities and understand the potential of quantum computing in the financial industry.

future large-scale quantum computers.

    <li>It follows that simulating the behavior of a quantum computer on a classical 
computer is exponentially expensive in terms of the number of qubits [13] 
and only feasible for small systems.
(因此，在经典计算机上模拟量子计算机的行为在量子比特数方面是指数级昂贵的[13]，并且仅适用于小系统。)</li>

  <ul>
    <li>A swap gate simply interchanges the state of two qubits and can therefore 
be used to move the relevant logical qubits to two connected physical qubits 
where the desired gate can be applied. However, performing swaps increases the 
number of operations, which has two main drawbacks. First, it slows the algorithm down, 
and second, since all gates on a practical quantum computer are noisy, 
it leads to more overall noise which can even result in the algorithm becoming 
unusable in practice.
