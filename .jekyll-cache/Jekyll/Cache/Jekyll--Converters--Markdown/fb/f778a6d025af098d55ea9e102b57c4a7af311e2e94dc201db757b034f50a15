    <li>Quantum computers can solve specific problems that are not 
feasible on â€œclassicalâ€ hardware. Harvesting the speed-up provided 
by quantum computers therefore has the potential to change any 
industry which uses computation, including finance. 
First quantum applications for the financial industry involving optimization, 
simulation, and machine learning problems have already been proposed and 
applied to use cases such as portfolio management, risk management, 
and pricing derivatives. This survey reviews platforms, algorithms, 
methodologies, and use cases of quantum computing for various applications 
in finance in a structured way. It is aimed at people working in the financial 
industry and serves to gain an overview of the current development and 
capabilities and understand the potential of quantum computing in the financial industry.

    <li>It follows that simulating the behavior of a quantum computer on a classical 
computer is exponentially expensive in terms of the number of qubits [13] 
and only feasible for small systems.

    <li>A swap gate simply interchanges the state of two qubits and can therefore 
be used to move the relevant logical qubits to two connected physical qubits 
where the desired gate can be applied. However, performing swaps increases the 
number of operations, which has two main drawbacks. First, it slows the algorithm down, 
and second, since all gates on a practical quantum computer are noisy, 
it leads to more overall noise which can even result in the algorithm becoming 
unusable in practice.

    <li>In a similar way, the challenge that quantum gates are noisy and quickly lead to 
calculations which are unreliable can be tackled using quantum error correction [15]. 
This comes at the expense of needing even more qubits. Once quantum computers pass 
the size needed to implement error correction, they can correct the errors during a 
calculation, which will in turn allow even larger computations to be made.
