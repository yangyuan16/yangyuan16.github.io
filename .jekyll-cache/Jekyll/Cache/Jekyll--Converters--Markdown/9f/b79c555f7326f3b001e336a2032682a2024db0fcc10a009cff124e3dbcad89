  <p>Against this background, we ask whether, in such a market, <font color="red"> technical indicators from collectivistic investment behavior </font> 
matter more for asset pricing than <font color="red">firm fundamentals</font>.</p>

  <p>Therefore, we examine whether return predictability and portfolio performance are compromised for SOEs 
where government signaling plays such a prominent role.</p>

  <p>Given that China has been experiencing a highly dynamic development through a series of structural breaks, implementing various 
financial reforms, and expanding its capital markets’ openness, we conjecture that highly 
fiexible methods are required to account for the Chinese market’s specificity.</p>

  <p>As out-of-sample R^2 has some limitations for model selection, 
we analyze the models’ <font color="red">conditional predictive ability</font> using a 
statistical test recently developed in <font color="red">Li, Liao and Quaedvlieg (2020)</font>,
which allows us to compare the performance of machine learning methods 
in different macroeconomic environments.

方法能够评价机器学习在宏观经济环境中的表现！！！)</p>
