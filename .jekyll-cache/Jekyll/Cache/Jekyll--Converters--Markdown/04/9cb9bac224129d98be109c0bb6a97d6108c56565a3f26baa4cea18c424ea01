===========================</p>

  <p>Chinese stock market is dominated by retail investors. The <font color="red">speculative</font> 
and short-term trading motives of many retail investors may lead to 
increased <font color="red">turnover</font>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>According to the 2019 yearbook of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, there are 214.5 million
  investors in china, 213.8 million are <font color="red">individual investors</font>, and 0.7 million are
      <font color="red">institutional investors</font>
    </li>
    <li>the value of shares traded stood at 224% of <font color="red">market capitalization</font>
in 2019, compared to 108% for the U.S. market.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Another feature that distinguishes the Chinese from the U.S. market is the high 
predictability of large stocks and state-owned enterprises over longer horizons. 
The out-of-sample performance remains economically significant 
after <font color="red"> transaction costs</font>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of October 2020, the total value of China’s stock market has climbed to 
a record high of more than $10 trillion, as the country’s accelerating economic 
recovery from the pandemic has surpassed the previous high reached during an 
equity bubble five years ago, making it the second-largest in the 
world, after the U.S. at nearly $39 trillion.</p>

<h3 id="politic">politic</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1)For example, the process of IPOs and seasonal stock offerings is highly political, 
and companies cannot predict when the market value will be high.</p>

  <p>(2)On the other hand, <font color="red">listed companies</font>, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 
are prevented from shares buy-back when share prices fall below fundamental values.
These automatic market correction mechanisms are therefore affected by government-oriented restrictions</p>

  <p>(3)Given that China has been experiencing a highly dynamic development through a series of structural breaks, implementing various 
financial reforms, and expanding its capital markets’ openness, we conjecture that highly 
fiexible methods are required to account for the Chinese market’s specificity.</p>

  <p>While most of the literature on <font color="red">factor investing</font> in
U.S. and European markets rely on long-short strategies, such a strategy is 
less realistic for Chinese market. Hence, we also analyze <font color="red"> long-only portfolios</font>
which are more relevant from a practitioner’s viewpoint.</p>
