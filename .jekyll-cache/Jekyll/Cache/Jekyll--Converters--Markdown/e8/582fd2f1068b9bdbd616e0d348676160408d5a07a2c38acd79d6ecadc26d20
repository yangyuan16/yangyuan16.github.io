<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Quantum computers can solve specific problems that are not 
feasible on ‚Äúclassical‚Äù hardware. Harvesting the speed-up provided 
by quantum computers therefore has the potential to change any 
industry which uses computation, including finance. 
First quantum applications for the financial industry involving optimization, 
simulation, and machine learning problems have already been proposed and 
applied to use cases such as portfolio management, risk management, 
and pricing derivatives. This survey reviews platforms, algorithms, 
methodologies, and use cases of quantum computing for various applications 
in finance in a structured way. It is aimed at people working in the financial 
industry and serves to gain an overview of the current development and 
capabilities and understand the potential of quantum computing in the financial industry.
