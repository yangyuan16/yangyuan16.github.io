    <li>Quantum computers can solve specific problems that are not 
feasible on “classical” hardware. Harvesting the speed-up provided 
by quantum computers therefore has the potential to change any 
industry which uses computation, including finance. 
First quantum applications for the financial industry involving optimization, 
simulation, and machine learning problems have already been proposed and 
applied to use cases such as portfolio management, risk management, 
and pricing derivatives. This survey reviews platforms, algorithms, 
methodologies, and use cases of quantum computing for various applications 
in finance in a structured way. It is aimed at people working in the financial 
industry and serves to gain an overview of the current development and 
capabilities and understand the potential of quantum computing in the financial industry.

    <li>It follows that simulating the behavior of a quantum computer on a classical 
computer is exponentially expensive in terms of the number of qubits [13] 
and only feasible for small systems.

  <ul>
    <li>A swap gate simply interchanges the state of two qubits and can therefore 
be used to move the relevant logical qubits to two connected physical qubits 
where the desired gate can be applied. However, performing swaps increases the 
number of operations, which has two main drawbacks. First, it slows the algorithm down, 
and second, since all gates on a practical quantum computer are noisy, 
it leads to more overall noise which can even result in the algorithm becoming 
unusable in practice.
(交换门简单地交换两个量子位的状态，因此可以用于将相关的逻辑量子位移动到两个连接的物理量子位，
在那里可以应用所需的门。然而，执行交换增加了操作的数量，这有两个主要缺点。
首先，它减慢了算法的速度，其次，由于实际量子计算机上的所有门都有噪声，
它会导致更大的总体噪声，甚至可能导致算法在实践中变得不可用)。</li>

  <ul>
    <li>In a similar way, the challenge that quantum gates are noisy and quickly lead to 
calculations which are unreliable can be tackled using quantum error correction [15]. 
This comes at the expense of needing even more qubits. Once quantum computers pass 
the size needed to implement error correction, they can correct the errors during a 
calculation, which will in turn allow even larger computations to be made.
(以类似的方式，量子门噪声大且很快导致计算不可靠的挑战可以通过量子纠错来解决[15]。
这是以需要更多量子比特为代价的。一旦量子计算机通过了实现纠错所需的大小，
它们就可以在计算过程中纠正错误，从而允许进行更大的计算。)。</li>

    <li>Further development of quantum software could reduce the hardware 
requirements of quantum computers and, in turn, lead to earlier applications 
of quantum computers in the financial services industry. 
While it can be a struggle to build the hardware that could support ambitious algorithms, 
the theoretical speed-up predicted for these algorithms is also a reminder 
of the potential of quantum computing. Algorithm research and hardware development 
therefore incentivize each other [16]. 
Experimental progress is necessary to unlock the full potential of quantum computing. 
However, it is possible that noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers 
will find interesting applications far before general-purpose, 
fault-tolerant quantum computing is available [17].
(量子软件的进一步开发可以降低量子计算机的硬件需求，
进而导致量子计算机在金融服务行业的早期应用。
虽然构建能够支持雄心勃勃的算法的硬件可能是一项艰巨的任务，
但预测这些算法的理论速度也提醒我们量子计算的潜力。
因此，算法研究和硬件开发相互激励[16]。实验进展对于充分挖掘量子计算的潜力是必要的。
然而，在通用容错量子计算出现之前，
有噪声的中等规模量子计算机可能会发现有趣的应用[17]。).</li>

    <li>The literature on the impacts of quantum computers on the financial industry or 
an estimate of the potential monetary benefits is scarce. It was suggested in [21] that 
applying quantum computing in finance results in enhancing investment gains, 
reducing capital requirements, creating new investment opportunities, and 
improving risk management and compliance. It was stated in [23] that application of 
quantum computing could lead to an increase in cyber-security, accelerate high frequency 
trading, or lead to greater accuracy in the simulation of customers’ purchasing preferences, 
resulting in an improved data-driven customer relation management.
