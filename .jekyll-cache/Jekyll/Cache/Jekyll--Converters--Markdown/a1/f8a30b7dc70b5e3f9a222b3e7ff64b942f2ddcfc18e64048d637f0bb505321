<h3 id="main-results">Main results</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Neutral networks robustly outperform other methods in terms of 
out-of-sample R^2</p>

  <p>(2) The out-of-sample R^2 are particularly large for the subsamples 
of <font color="red">small firms</font> and non-state-owned firms. Hence,
predictability is more significant for those subsamples of stocks in which <font color="red">retail traders</font> plays a much bigger role.</p>

  <p>(3) Comparing the out-of-sample R^2 with studies in the U.S. market, 
the Chinese market reveals substantially more predictability.</p>

  <p>We also find that predictability of SOEs (å›½æœ‰ä¼ä¸š) in terms of out-of-sample predictive R^2 
is <font color="red">weaker</font> than for <font color="red">non-SOEs</font> at 
a <font color="red">monthly prediction horizon</font>, which confirms the SOEâ€™s reputation of 
being <font color="red">non-transparent</font> (å›½ä¼çš„å£°èª‰å¹¶ä¸é€æ˜).</p>

  <p>Our results indicate that also that a long-only portfolio can provide substantial and, 
even after including transaction costs, economically signicant performance
