<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Neutral networks robustly outperform other methods in terms of 
out-of-sample R^2</p>

  <p>(2) The out-of-sample R^2 are particularly large for the subsamples 
of <font color="red">small firms</font> and non-state-owned firms. Hence,
predictability is more significant for those subsamples of stocks in which</p>
  <font color="red">retail traders</font>
  <p>plays a much bigger role.</p>

  <p>(3) Comparing the out-of-sample R^2 with studies in the U.S. market, 
the Chinese market reveals substantially more predictability.</p>
