    <li>Quantum computers can solve specific problems that are not 
feasible on â€œclassicalâ€ hardware. Harvesting the speed-up provided 
by quantum computers therefore has the potential to change any 
industry which uses computation, including finance. 
First quantum applications for the financial industry involving optimization, 
simulation, and machine learning problems have already been proposed and 
applied to use cases such as portfolio management, risk management, 
and pricing derivatives. This survey reviews platforms, algorithms, 
methodologies, and use cases of quantum computing for various applications 
in finance in a structured way. It is aimed at people working in the financial 
industry and serves to gain an overview of the current development and 
capabilities and understand the potential of quantum computing in the financial industry.

    <li>A swap gate simply interchanges the state of two qubits and can therefore 
be used to move the relevant logical qubits to two connected physical qubits 
where the desired gate can be applied. However, performing swaps increases the 
number of operations, which has two main drawbacks. First, it slows the algorithm down, 
and second, since all gates on a practical quantum computer are noisy, 
it leads to more overall noise which can even result in the algorithm becoming 
unusable in practice.

    <li>In a similar way, the challenge that quantum gates are noisy and quickly lead to 
calculations which are unreliable can be tackled using quantum error correction [15]. 
This comes at the expense of needing even more qubits. Once quantum computers pass 
the size needed to implement error correction, they can correct the errors during a 
calculation, which will in turn allow even larger computations to be made.

    <li>Further development of quantum software could reduce the hardware 
requirements of quantum computers and, in turn, lead to earlier applications 
of quantum computers in the financial services industry. 
While it can be a struggle to build the hardware that could support ambitious algorithms, 
the theoretical speed-up predicted for these algorithms is also a reminder 
of the potential of quantum computing. Algorithm research and hardware development 
therefore incentivize each other [16]. 
Experimental progress is necessary to unlock the full potential of quantum computing. 
However, it is possible that noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers 
will find interesting applications far before general-purpose, 
fault-tolerant quantum computing is available [17].

    <li>The literature on the impacts of quantum computers on the financial industry or 
an estimate of the potential monetary benefits is scarce. It was suggested in [21] that 
applying quantum computing in finance results in enhancing investment gains, 
reducing capital requirements, creating new investment opportunities, and 
improving risk management and compliance. It was stated in [23] that application of 
quantum computing could lead to an increase in cyber-security, accelerate high frequency 
trading, or lead to greater accuracy in the simulation of customersâ€™ purchasing preferences, 
resulting in an improved data-driven customer relation management.

    <li>The authors in [1] write that the race in the field of quantum computing 
is largely motivated by the disruption the technology is expected to bring, 
resulting in a complete transformation of the financial services industry. 
However, the authors do not elaborate on the expected degree of disruption or impact. 
The high expectations might be explained by the theoretical speedup compared 
to classical computers. However, it is still very difficult to 
estimate when the technology will be available to exploit the potential of 
these algorithms. For instance, in [24] it is suggested that we stand at least 
five years away from quantum computing significantly impacting the financial 
services landscape. This is in line with the authors of [19] who state that 
widely-adopted commercial applications may remain several years away. 
Also, there are no estimates as to how expensive maintaining 
the infrastructure and thus running a quantum computer will be.
