<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>the Chinese stock market differs from the U.S. stock market in two important
aspects: <font color="red">trading environment</font> 
and <font color="red">information environment</font>.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>After risk adjustment, we find that 97 CAPM alphas are significant,
16 CH3 alphas are significant and 15 CH4 alphas are significant.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The CAPM alphas are very similar to the raw return, indicating that 
the market risk fails to explain these anomaly returns.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>In contrast, with embedded size, value and turnover effects, the
CH3 and CH4 models are able to explain away a significant part of anomaly
raw returns, and thus we foucs our discussion on alphas using this model.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Among the 16 significant alphas relative to CH3 factors, 7 anomalies are 
constructed using liquidity-related information, and 4 are related to 
accounting-related information.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Among the 15 significant alphas relative to the CH4 factors, 
half of anomalies are from trading-related information and half of them 
are from accounting-related information.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>we consturct the composite anomalies with score, Fama-MacBeth regression, 
Lasso, and Random Forest by combining many signals. 
In total, we construct 10 composite anomalies with all characteristics in each 
category, sub-category, and in total.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>We find that the majority of the composite anomalies can pass the 
multiple hurdle of 2.85
After risk adjustment with the CH3 factors, almost half of the composite anomalies 
are still significant, with the majority of them from trading-related anomalies.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>There are still signigicant CH4 alphas using random forecast method, which
are from the trading-related group. <font color="red"> It indicates that the 
popular machine learning methods of Lasso and Random Forest outperform the 
traditional methods of score and Fama-MacBeth regression</font> 
The composite anomalies confirm that trading-related anomalies are 
very important in China.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>We compare the anomaly results in China with those in the United States, as in Hou, Xue
and Zhang (2019), and identify three major differences. First, out of the 426 anomalies, 23% of
anomalies are significant in China, which is lower than the replication rate (35%) in the United
States, with the same hurdle being the absolute t-value above 1.96.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Second, most of the significant anomalies in China are trading-related anomalies, using
characteristics such as volatility, turnover, and dollar trading volume, especially liquidity
measures; while almost all trading frictions anomalies are insignificant in the United States as in
Hou, Xue and Zhang (2019).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Third, most of the significant anomalies in the United States are driven by firm fundamental
information in accounting statements, such as value, investment, and profitability; while in China,
these variables mostly cannot provide statistically significant information about future stock
returns.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>All papers find that some anomalies working in the United States may mot
be replicated in other countries.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Jacobs and Muller (2019) study how 241 anomalies decay after publication 
across 39 international markets, and find that the United States is the only
country with a reliable post-publication decline in long-short returns.</li>
  </ul>

exchanges, and are open to domestic investors to trade.</li>

    <li>For the accounting information, the data on the balance sheet and income 
statement stat in 1990, and the data on the cash flow statement start from

        <li>Before 2002, financial statements are reported annually or semiannually,
and after 2002, they are reported quarterly.</li>
