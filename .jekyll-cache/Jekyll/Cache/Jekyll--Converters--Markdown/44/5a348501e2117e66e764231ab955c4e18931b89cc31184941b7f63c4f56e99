===========================</p>

  <p>Chinese stock market is dominated by retail investors. The <font color="red">speculative</font> 
and short-term trading motives of many retail investors may lead to 
increased <font color="red">turnover</font>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>According to the 2019 yearbook of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, there are 214.5 million
  investors in china, 213.8 million are <font color="red">individual investors</font>, and 0.7 million are
      <font color="red">institutional investors</font>
    </li>
    <li>the value of shares traded stood at 224% of <font color="red">market capitalization</font>
in 2019, compared to 108% for the U.S. market.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>=================================================</p>

  <p>creates heightened volatility that may disconnect share prices from  <br />
the underlying economic conditions.</p>

  <p>=================================================</p>

  <p>Especially the large proportion of small investors with <font color="red">speculative short-term behavior</font>, 
make this market a highly attractive target for applying <font color="red">modern machine learning</font> techniques</p>

  <p>=================================================</p>

  <p>!!! <font color="red">retail investor 和 machine learning 的关系</font>:
我们将短期可预测性（尤其是小型股）归因于散户投资者在中国股市中的突出作用。
正如我们稍后将看到的，在较短的视野内，<font color="red">神经网络更加重视小盘股的波动性和动量相关变量</font>，
这可能反映了散户投资者的短期投机行为，以及他们的知名度也就是喜欢优先交易小型股。 
(We attribute the short-term predictability, particularly for small stocks, to retail investors’ prominent role in the Chinese stock market. As we will see later, at shorter horizons, neural nets put more weight on volatility and momentum-related variables for small stocks, which may reflect the short-term speculative behavior of retail investors, together with their well-known
preference for trading small stocks)</p>

  <p>Another feature that distinguishes the Chinese from the U.S. market is the high 
predictability of large stocks and state-owned enterprises over longer horizons. 
The out-of-sample performance remains economically significant 
after <font color="red"> transaction costs</font>.</p>

  <p>It seems that predicting SOEs’ returns requires a highly flexible method that can
account for nonlinear effect. This additional complexity may be required since
SOEs are controlled by the state, having two primary objectives:
to generate profit and to carry out state policies.
(似乎预测国有企业的回报需要一种高度灵活的方法，可以考虑非线性效应。
由于国有企业由国家控制，有两个主要目标：创造利润和执行国家政策，因此可能需要额外的复杂性 )
However, our results contrast earlier studies that argue that predicting
stock returns for Chinese SOEs is not easy due to their 
nancial opacity and low informativeness of
share prices(然而，我们的结果与早期的研究形成了对比，早期的研究认为中国国有企业的股票回报并不容易，因为它们的“财务不透明”和信息量低股价 )</p>

  <p>As of October 2020, the total value of China’s stock market has climbed to 
a record high of more than $10 trillion, as the country’s accelerating economic 
recovery from the pandemic has surpassed the previous high reached during an 
equity bubble five years ago, making it the second-largest in the 
world, after the U.S. at nearly $39 trillion.</p>

  <p>(1)For example, the process of IPOs and seasonal stock offerings is highly political, 
and companies cannot predict when the market value will be high.</p>

  <p>(2)On the other hand, <font color="red">listed companies</font>, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 
are prevented from shares buy-back when share prices fall below fundamental values.
These automatic market correction mechanisms are therefore affected by government-oriented restrictions</p>

  <p>(3)Given that China has been experiencing a highly dynamic development through a series of structural breaks, implementing various 
financial reforms, and expanding its capital markets’ openness, we conjecture that highly 
fiexible methods are required to account for the Chinese market’s specificity.</p>

  <p>While most of the literature on <font color="red">factor investing</font> in
U.S. and European markets rely on long-short strategies, such a strategy is 
less realistic for Chinese market. Hence, we also analyze <font color="red"> long-only portfolios</font>
which are more relevant from a practitioner’s viewpoint.</p>

  <p>Given the <font color="red">short-selling constraints</font> in China, we wonder how much <font color="red">value-added</font>
can be enjoyed in <font color="red">long-only mandates</font>. 
Many of the previous literature results relate to the performance 
of portfolios that include long and short positions. While such practices allow us to 
evaluate a signal’s predictive power, not all stocks are available for shorting at all times, 
and the costs of shorting can be substantial.

  <p>A rapidly growing number of studies examine the cross-section and the 
time-series of stock returns with machine learning tools, predominantly 
focusing on the U.S. market.</p>

  <p>Their results suggest that machine learning improves the description of expected return and, 
when applied to portfolio construction, performance improvements arise most prominently among 
the more sophisticated models and are due in large part to the allowance of non-linear predictor 
interactions that are missed by simpler methods</p>

  <p>Although machine learning may substantially improve the pricing of assets, Arnott et al. (2019), 
Gu et al. (2020b), and Israel et al. (2020), among others, 
also point out that these methods cannot identify <font color="red">deep fundamental economic principles</font>.</p>

<h3 id="r2">R^2</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Comparing the out-of-sample R^2 with studies in the U.S. market, the Chinese 
market reveals substantially more predictability.</p>

  <p>R^2 has <font color="red">some limitations for model selection</font>
(R^2 并不能作为衡量所有机器学习模型的一个普适的指标)</p>

  <p>We also find that predictability of SOEs (国有企业) in terms of out-of-sample predictive R^2 
is <font color="red">weaker</font> than for <font color="red">non-SOEs</font> at 
a <font color="red">monthly prediction horizon</font>, which confirms the SOE’s reputation of 
being <font color="red">non-transparent</font> (国企的声誉并不透明).</p>

  <p>It is noteworthy that the OLS model performs much better in China’s stock market than
in the U.S. stock market. The R^2 for the latter has been reported to be negative (-3.46%)
in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhaa009">Gu et al. (2020b)</a>.</p>

  <p>Such significant gaps in R^2 further motivates us to consider the fundamental difference
between these two markets, which we conjecture, can be attributed to two critical aspects.
First, the Chinese stock market is characterized by a large fraction of retail investors
and their preference for small-cap stocks. Second, the Chinese stock market is influenced 
by the prevalence of state-owned enterprises, which are less transparent than private firms.</p>
