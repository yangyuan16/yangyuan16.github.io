  <p>Against this background, we ask whether, in such a market, <font color="red"> technical indicators from collectivistic investment behavior </font>

  <p>Therefore, we examine whether return predictability and portfolio performance are compromised for SOEs 
where government signaling plays such a prominent role.</p>

  <p>Given that China has been experiencing a highly dynamic development through a series of structural breaks, implementing various

  <p>As out-of-sample R^2 has some limitations for model selection, 
we analyze the modelsâ€™ <font color="red">conditional predictive ability</font> using a

which allows us to compare the performance of machine learning methods
