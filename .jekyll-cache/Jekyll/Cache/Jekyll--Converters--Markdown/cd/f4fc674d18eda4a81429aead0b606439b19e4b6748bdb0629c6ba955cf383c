<blockquote>
  <p>There are two types of shares in the mainland China stock market, A-shares and B-shares. A-shares are quoted
only in renminbi, while B-shares are quoted in foreign currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, and are available to foreign
investors on a larger scale. Foreign investors may have diculties accessing A-shares due to Chinese government
regulations, and Chinese investors may have difficulties accessing B-shares, mainly for currency exchange reasons.
Some companies choose to list their shares in both the A-share and B-share markets. According to public information,
the Wind database serves more than 90% of Chinese nancial institutions and 70% of Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investors (QFII) operating in China.</p>
