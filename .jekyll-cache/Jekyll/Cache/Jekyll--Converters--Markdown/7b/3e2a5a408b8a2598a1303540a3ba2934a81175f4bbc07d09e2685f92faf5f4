  <ul>
    <li>It is a <font color="red">fundamental question of financial economics 
whether assets with different risk exposures and characteristics are priced 
to earn different rates of return</font>. 
I survey studies in empirical cross-sectional asset pricing that provide evidence 
on this question and relate the evidence to models of investor preferences and beliefs. 
I begin by laying out a framework that will be helpful for categorizing 
and interpreting empirical work in this area.</li>
  </ul>
