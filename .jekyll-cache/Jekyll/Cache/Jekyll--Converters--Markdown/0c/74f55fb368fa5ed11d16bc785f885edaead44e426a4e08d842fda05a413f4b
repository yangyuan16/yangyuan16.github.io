  <p>There are two types of shares in the mainland China stock market, A-shares and B-shares. A-shares are quoted
only in <font color="red">renminbi</font>, while B-shares are quoted in foreign currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, and are available to foreign
investors on a larger scale. Foreign investors may have difficulties accessing A-shares due to Chinese <font color="red">government
regulations</font>, and Chinese investors may have difficulties accessing B-shares, mainly for currency exchange reasons.
Some companies choose to <font color="red">list</font> their shares in both the A-share and B-share markets. 
According to public information, the Wind database serves more than 90% of Chinese financial 
institutions and 70% of <font color="red">Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investors (QFII)</font> operating in China.
中国大陆股市有两种股票，A股和B股。A股仅以人民币报价，而B股则以外币报价，如美国，并向外国投资者提供更大规模的服务。
由于中国政府的监管，外国投资者可能难以获得A股，而中国投资者可能无法获得B股，主要是因为货币兑换的原因。
一些公司选择在A股和B股市场上市。
根据公开信息，Wind数据库服务于90%以上的中国金融机构和70%在中国运营的合格外国机构投资者（QFII）。</p>

  <p>Against this background, we ask whether, in such a market, <font color="red"> technical indicators from collectivistic investment behavior </font> 
matter more for asset pricing than <font color="red">firm fundamentals</font>.</p>

  <p>Therefore, we examine whether return predictability and portfolio performance are compromised for SOEs 
where government signaling plays such a prominent role.</p>

  <p>Given that China has been experiencing a highly dynamic development through a series of structural breaks, implementing various 
financial reforms, and expanding its capital markets’ openness, we conjecture that highly 
fiexible methods are required to account for the Chinese market’s specificity.</p>

  <p>As out-of-sample R^2 has some limitations for model selection, 
we analyze the models’ <font color="red">conditional predictive ability</font> using a 
statistical test recently developed in <font color="red">Li, Liao and Quaedvlieg (2020)</font>,
which allows us to compare the performance of machine learning methods 
in different macroeconomic environments. 
(R^2 并不能作为衡量所有机器学习模型的一个普适的指标。Li, Liao, Quaedvlieg 发展出的
方法能够评价机器学习在宏观经济环境中的表现！！！)</p>
