  <p>There are two types of shares in the mainland China stock market, A-shares and B-shares. A-shares are quoted
only in <font color="red">renminbi</font>, while B-shares are quoted in foreign currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, and are available to foreign
investors on a larger scale. Foreign investors may have difficulties accessing A-shares due to Chinese <font color="red">government
regulations</font>, and Chinese investors may have difficulties accessing B-shares, mainly for currency exchange reasons.
Some companies choose to <font color="red">list</font> their shares in both the A-share and B-share markets. 
According to public information, the Wind database serves more than 90% of Chinese financial 
institutions and 70% of <font color="red">Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investors (QFII)</font> operating in China.

matter more for asset pricing than <font color="red">firm fundamentals</font>.</p>

  <p>Therefore, we examine whether return predictability and portfolio performance are compromised for SOEs 
where government signaling plays such a prominent role.</p>

  <p>Given that China has been experiencing a highly dynamic development through a series of structural breaks, implementing various 
financial reforms, and expanding its capital marketsâ€™ openness, we conjecture that highly 
fiexible methods are required to account for the Chinese marketâ€™s specificity.</p>
