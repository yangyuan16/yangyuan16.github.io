  <p>As of October 2020, the total value of Chinaâ€™s stock market has climbed to 
a record high of more than $10 trillion, as the countryâ€™s accelerating economic 
recovery from the pandemic has surpassed the previous high reached during an 
equity bubble five years ago, making it the second-largest in the 
world, after the U.S. at nearly $39 trillion.</p>

and companies cannot predict when the market value will be high.</p>

  <p>(2)On the other hand, <font color="red">listed companies</font>, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs), 
are prevented from shares buy-back when share prices fall below fundamental values.
These automatic market correction mechanisms are therefore affected by government-oriented restrictions</p>
