<blockquote>
  <p>There are two types of shares in the mainland China stock market, A-shares and B-shares. A-shares are quoted
only in <font color="red">renminbi</font>, while B-shares are quoted in foreign currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, and are available to foreign
investors on a larger scale. Foreign investors may have difficulties accessing A-shares due to Chinese government
regulations, and Chinese investors may have difficulties accessing B-shares, mainly for currency exchange reasons.
Some companies choose to list their shares in both the A-share and B-share markets. According to public information,
the Wind database serves more than 90% of Chinese financial institutions and 70% of Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investors (QFII) operating in China.
中国大陆股市有两种股票，A股和B股。A股仅以人民币报价，而B股则以外币报价，如美国，并向外国投资者提供更大规模的服务。
由于中国政府的监管，外国投资者可能难以获得A股，而中国投资者可能无法获得B股，主要是因为货币兑换的原因。
一些公司选择在A股和B股市场上市。
根据公开信息，Wind数据库服务于90%以上的中国金融机构和70%在中国运营的合格外国机构投资者（QFII）。</p>
